# Asteroids Genetic Algorithm & Q-Learning
 
## CS441 Artificial Intelligence Group Project
In this project we compare and contrast the performances of genetic algorithms and reinforced learning by making use of the game asteroids within Python.

## Instructions
To successfully run this project you must have previously installed pygame.

For windows this can be done after installing python 3.6.1 or greater from [here](https://www.python.org/). Afterwards make sure you have python added to your PATH and then use the command ``py -m pip install -U pygame --user``.

For linux also ensure you have python installed from [here](https://www.python.org/) and then make use of the ``python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`` command

To run the game simply type ``py main.py`` in the command prompt/terminal after setting the desired algorithm flags within main.py.
## Testing
For unit testing we did...
